# Flood Risk Analysis in Accra, Ghana

## Overview
This project applies geospatial analytics to assess flood risk in Accra, Ghana. By integrating elevation data, river proximity, and urban land use, the study identifies flood-prone zones and demonstrates spatial data science workflows relevant to urban resilience research.

## Objectives
- Identify high-risk flood zones in Accra
- Demonstrate GIS-based spatial analysis using Python
- Support data-driven urban planning discussions

## Data Sources
- Digital Elevation Model (DEM)
- OpenStreetMap rivers and roads
- Urban boundary data for Accra

## Methods
- Spatial buffering of river networks
- Elevation-based risk classification
- Overlay analysis and visualization

## Tools
- Python
- GeoPandas
- Rasterio
- Matplotlib

## Study Area
Accra Metropolitan Area, Ghana

## Project Status
This project is under active development. Current work focuses on establishing the spatial analysis workflow. Future updates will include integration of real-world datasets and enhanced flood susceptibility modeling.

## Relevance
Flooding is a major urban challenge in Accra, Ghana. This project demonstrates how geospatial analytics can support data-driven decision-making for urban resilience and disaster risk reduction.
