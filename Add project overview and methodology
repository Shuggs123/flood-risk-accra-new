# Flood Risk Analysis in Accra, Ghana

## Overview
This project applies geospatial analytics to assess flood risk in Accra, Ghana. By integrating elevation data, river proximity, and urban land use, the study identifies flood-prone zones and demonstrates spatial data science workflows relevant to urban resilience research.

## Objectives
- Identify high-risk flood zones in Accra
- Demonstrate GIS-based spatial analysis using Python
- Support data-driven urban planning discussions

## Data Sources
- Digital Elevation Model (DEM)
- OpenStreetMap rivers and roads
- Urban boundary data for Accra

## Methods
- Spatial buffering of river networks
- Elevation-based risk classification
- Overlay analysis and visualization

## Tools
- Python
- GeoPandas
- Rasterio
- Matplotlib

## Study Area
Accra Metropolitan Area, Ghana

## Project Status
This project is under active development. Current work focuses on establishing the spatial analysis workflow. Future updates will include integration of real-world datasets and enhanced flood susceptibility modeling.

## Relevance
Flooding is a major urban challenge in Accra, Ghana. This project demonstrates how geospatial analytics can support data-driven decision-making for urban resilience and disaster risk reduction.

## Sample Output

Below is a demonstration flood risk map generated using the Python workflow in this repository.  
The map highlights areas of higher flood susceptibility based on simulated terrain and river proximity, inspired by flooding challenges in Accra, Ghana.
